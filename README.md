_Akinator for Python!_

This a python application that uses the [Akinator websocket API](http://en.akinator.com) to bring awesomeness to python!
I made this after seeing a bunch of NodeJS Akinator APIs but none for python.

## INSTALLATION

_(assuming python 3.x)_

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -e .
```

## USAGE

Run me from the command line with the following:

`bin/pykinator_cli.py`

or get down and dirty with the package itself
