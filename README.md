_Akinator for Python!_

This a python application that uses the [Akinator websocket API](http://en.akinator.com) to bring awesomeness to python!
I made this after seeing a bunch of NodeJS Akinator APIs but none for python.

## INSTALLATION

# Newbies
_(assuming python 3.x)_

`python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
`pip install -e .`

# Usage

Run me from the command line with the following:

`bin/pykinator.py`

or get down and dirty with the package itself

`pykinator/bot.py`

# TODO

Test scripts, additional documentation, etc.
